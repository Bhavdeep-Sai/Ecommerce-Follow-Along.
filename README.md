# Milestone 4: Backend Enhancements
In this milestone, we made several important updates to our e-commerce application. Here's a summary of what we did:

### Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
By the end of this milestone, we accomplished the following:
1. **Created a User Model**: This is like a blueprint for how we store user data, such as name, email, and password, in the database.
2. **Created a User Controller**: This part of the server manages user data. It handles actions like adding a new user or getting user information.
3. **Enabled File Uploads with Multer**: Multer is a tool that helps our app accept and store files (like profile pictures) uploaded by users.

### 1. Whatâ€™s a Model?
A model is like a detailed map or plan. When we create a User Model, we're designing how a userâ€™s data will look in the database. Think of it like drawing a blueprint for a house. The model defines what information we need to store for each user.

### 2. Whatâ€™s a Controller?
A controller is a part of the server that manages what happens when someone interacts with our app. For example, if someone wants to sign up, the controller handles the data sent to the server. Think of the controller as a "manager" of requests and responses, making sure everything goes smoothly.

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Sometimes, users want to upload files like profile pictures. Multer is a tool that makes it easy to upload files to our server. It helps us store user images in the backend, like a virtual file cabinet for storing pictures.
