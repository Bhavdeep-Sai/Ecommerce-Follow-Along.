# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Overview
The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project is a hands-on learning experience designed to guide you through the process of building a full-fledged e-commerce application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project aims to provide practical experience with real-world development concepts and tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
In this milestone, you will:
- Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learn the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
- Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Prepare for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.


## Milestone 2: Login Page Layout Added
In this milestone, we have successfully added the layout for the Login Page. This includes the following key features:
- **User Interface Design**: The Login Page has been designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for optimal usability.
- **Form Elements**: The Login Page includes essential form elements such as input fields for email and password, and a submit button.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS has been used to style the Login Page, providing a modern and consistent look and feel.

#### Key Components

- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling to inform users of any issues with their input.


## Milestone 3: Backend Added

In this milestone, we have successfully added the backend for our e-commerce application. This includes the following key features:

### Key Features:
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented several API endpoints for handling user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated MongoDB to store and retrieve data, ensuring a seamless connection between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication**: Added user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user data and restrict access to certain endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling to provide informative responses and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Middleware**: Used middleware to handle tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and managing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

This milestone lays the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application, providing essential functionality to support user interactions and data management. We will continue to build on this foundation in upcoming milestones to enhance the features and improve the user experience.
